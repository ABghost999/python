'''
Class project 1 –
“Rock, Paper, Scissors”
Your first python Project is to create a “Rock, Paper, scissors” game.
The is a game where the player plays against the computer.
1. You must use functions to create this game.

2. This program will keep playing until the user chooses to stop.

3. You must use the “random” library in your code.

4. Try to be creative and implement more features to the game and make
it your own (win counting, playing the best out of 5, allowing 2 players
to play each other, etc..).

5. If you are stuck, you can use the internet for help but use your own
coding skills and understand every line you are writing.'''
